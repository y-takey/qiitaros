There is a .eslint.yaml config for eslint ready with React plugin.

```

To do the actual linting, run:

```
npm run lint
```

### Notes on importing css styles
* styles having /src/ in their absolute path are considered part of the application and exported as local css modules.
* other styles are considered global styles used by many components and are included in the css bundle directly.
